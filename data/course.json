  "course_description": "Managers and engineers are constantly attempting to optimize, particularly in the design and operation of complex systems. This course is an application-oriented introduction to (systems) optimization. It seeks to:\n\n*   Motivate the use of optimization models to support managers and engineers in a wide variety of decision making situations;\n*   Show how several application domains (industries) use optimization;\n*   Introduce optimization modeling and solution techniques (including linear, non-linear, integer, and network optimization, and heuristic methods);\n*   Provide tools for interpreting and analyzing model-based solutions (sensitivity and post-optimality analysis, bounding techniques); and\n*   Develop the skills required to identify the opportunity and manage the implementation of an optimization-based decision support tool.\n",
